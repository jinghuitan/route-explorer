# Global Climbing Route Explorer ðŸ§—

## Overview
Welcome to Global Climbing Route Explorer! This project provides interactive visualisations and insights into 8a.nu data including grading, rating, climbing style, and climber demographics like height, all displayed on this Power BI dashboard.

## Project Features
- Interactive Power BI Dashboard: The dashboard includes insights on different factors such as number of crags, average rating and type of routes.
- Figma Design: Figma was used to design dashboard layout to enhance the overall user experience.
- Advanced Power BI Features: Utilized Power Query for data transformation and DAX for calculations to present data in engaging ways.

## Key Learning Objective
**1. Data Preparation & Transformation**
- Learned how to clean, sort, and enrich raw datasets using Power Query and DAX.
- Created calculated columns and measures to make the data more usable within the dashboard.

**2. Dashboard Design Fundamentals**
- Designed the layout and user flow from scratch using Figma, focusing on usability and storytelling.
- Applied key dashboard design principles such as visual hierarchy, colour consistency, and user-centric layout structuring.

**3. Interactive Visualisation Techniques**
- Implemented interactive features including slicers, cross-filtering visuals, and dynamic maps.
- Visualised climbing crags and routes with filters by grade and climber preference to enhance user exploration.
